RNAseq Demo

# Author: Kate Mortensen
# Last Update: 04-21-2021


# The purpose of this repo is to provide a demo for RNA seq analysis and differential expression. 
# The necessary libraries and tools are defined in the Singularity rna.def recipe file. 
# The necessary data preprocessing commands are defined in the rnaseq.sh script. 
# The diff_expression.R script produces output for analysis of differential expression. 

# TODO
# The user will have to manually download the sequences listed in the sequences.txt file into the sequences directory.
# Once this is done, the user should be able to execute the rnaseq.sh script and diff_expression.R script without an issue.
